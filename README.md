# REST_API_BLOG_v2

This is backend app, which allows to SignIn and SignUp users and also to create, read, delete and update posts and comments.

## Built with

- NodeJS (Express)
- MongoDb (mongoose)
- JWT
- Jest

## What i learned?

- ### Testing app with Jest

  This second version of my backend application. This version, in addition to testing the API with Insomnia, includes tests written using the Jest framework.
  I learned to write unit and integration tests. The API is tested with a test database. After all tests, the database is cleaned.

- ### Authorization and Authentication with JWT

  I learned how to create, verify JWT, authenticate users using JWT and how to create protected routes.
  I found out how the JWT works and how it is bulit.

## Continued development

I plan to add more functionality to this application that will go beyond basic CRUD operations. In the near future, these will be operations such as adding files, pagination, sorting and filtering, sending e-mails and CMS.
